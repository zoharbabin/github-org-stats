## Version History

### Pre-1.0.0 Development

The GitHub Organization Statistics Tool was developed through the consolidation of three separate scripts:

1. **github_org_stats.py** - Basic organization statistics
2. **github_org_stats_improved.py** - Enhanced repository analysis  
3. **github_multi_org_stats.py** - Multi-organization support

These scripts were unified into a single, comprehensive tool with enhanced features, better error handling, and professional packaging for open-source distribution.

### Migration Path

Users of the original scripts can migrate to version 1.0.0 using the provided migration guide. The unified tool maintains backward compatibility while providing significant improvements in functionality and reliability.
